Benjamin Nudelman and Kirill Vesialou
### Overview

Our project focused on the encryption portion of AES 128 and used networking to create a more real-life scenario or tool for the use of this encryption algorithm. Ultimately, a start and an end user both run commands in the terminal, with the start user inputting a file path and an ip address to connect to, and the user encoding the information within the file and sending it over to the end user.

### Instructions

The format in which the users run the program is with the following commands:

python3 user.py -SEND FILENAME IP

python3 user.py -RECIEVE
